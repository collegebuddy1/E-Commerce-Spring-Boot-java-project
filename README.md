# E-Commerce-Spring-Boot

This a web application project developing the e-commerce website to sell the electrical devices.
We use the Spring Boot to build the back-end part, and the React for the front-end part.
This Respository is for the back-end.

We have implemented the following functions:

  For Consumers:
  
    1. They can log in and sign up their accounts, and also change their personal information in their user page.
    
    2. They can scan the products and search for what they want by name, category, etc.
    
    3. They can scan the products sorted by price from low to high or even from high to low.
    
    4. They can add products into the cart, checkout and generate the orders.
